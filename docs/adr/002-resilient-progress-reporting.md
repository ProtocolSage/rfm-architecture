# ADR 002: Resilient Progress Reporting System

## Status
Proposed

## Context
Our RFM Architecture application now implements a WebSocket-based real-time progress reporting system that enables users to monitor long-running operations like fractal rendering. While the basic functionality is working, we need to enhance the system's resilience against network issues, server unavailability, and other potential failures.

Key considerations:
- WebSocket connections may drop unexpectedly
- The WebSocket server might be temporarily unavailable
- Operations may fail or be canceled
- Users need informative feedback when issues occur
- The system should recover gracefully from failures

## Decision
We will implement a comprehensive resilience strategy for the progress reporting system with the following components:

### 1. Enhanced WebSocket Client Reconnection Logic
- Implement automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- Add connection state management with clear transitions
- Create reconnection policies (max attempts, timeout periods)
- Add health checking to verify connection quality

### 2. Robust Error Handling
- Classify errors into recoverable and non-recoverable categories
- Implement graceful degradation for non-critical components
- Create user-friendly error messages for various failure scenarios
- Add error logging with appropriate context for diagnosis

### 3. Operation Recovery Mechanisms
- Implement operation resurrection for interrupted operations
- Add progress caching to restore state after reconnection
- Create cleanup mechanisms for stale operations
- Implement server-side tracking of client connections

### 4. User Experience Improvements
- Add clear visual indicators for connection status
- Provide estimated completion times based on progress rate
- Implement offline mode with limited functionality
- Create informative notifications for system status changes

### 5. Monitoring and Telemetry
- Add comprehensive logging for connection events and errors
- Implement performance metrics collection
- Create health dashboards for system components
- Add alerting for critical failures

## Consequences

### Positive
- Improved reliability of the progress reporting system
- Better user experience during connectivity issues
- Easier troubleshooting through enhanced logging
- Higher system resilience against transient failures
- Better insights into system behavior through monitoring

### Negative
- Increased code complexity for handling edge cases
- Additional resource usage for monitoring and connection management
- Potential false positives in reconnection logic
- Possible UI flicker during reconnection attempts

## Implementation Details

### WebSocket Client Enhancements
```python
class ResilentWebSocketClient:
    def __init__(self, url, max_reconnect_attempts=10, initial_backoff=1.0):
        self.url = url
        self.max_reconnect_attempts = max_reconnect_attempts
        self.initial_backoff = initial_backoff
        self.current_backoff = initial_backoff
        self.reconnect_attempts = 0
        self.connection_state = ConnectionState.DISCONNECTED
        self.cached_operations = {}
        # ...
        
    async def connect_with_backoff(self):
        while self.reconnect_attempts < self.max_reconnect_attempts:
            try:
                # Attempt connection
                # On success, reset backoff parameters
                self.current_backoff = self.initial_backoff
                self.reconnect_attempts = 0
                return True
            except ConnectionError:
                # Log failure
                # Increase backoff
                self.current_backoff = min(self.current_backoff * 1.5, MAX_BACKOFF)
                self.reconnect_attempts += 1
                await asyncio.sleep(self.current_backoff)
        
        # Max attempts reached
        return False
```

### UI Error Handling
```python
class ProgressUIHandler:
    def handle_connection_error(self, error):
        if isinstance(error, TransientError):
            # Show reconnecting indicator
            self.show_reconnecting_status()
        elif isinstance(error, ServerUnavailableError):
            # Show server unavailable message with retry option
            self.show_server_unavailable_dialog(
                message="Progress server unavailable. Operations will continue but progress updates will not be displayed.",
                retry_callback=self.reconnect
            )
        else:
            # Show generic error
            self.show_error_message(str(error))
```

### Operation Recovery
```python
class OperationTracker:
    def cache_operation_state(self, operation_id, state):
        # Store operation state locally
        self.operation_cache[operation_id] = state
        
    async def resurrect_operations(self):
        # After reconnection, restore tracked operations
        for operation_id, state in self.operation_cache.items():
            if state.status not in (Status.COMPLETED, Status.FAILED, Status.CANCELED):
                # Re-register operation with server
                await self.register_operation(operation_id, state)
```

## Metrics to Track
- Connection stability (mean time between disconnections)
- Reconnection success rate
- Operation completion rate
- Message delivery success rate
- UI responsiveness during connection issues
- Error frequency by category
