# GPU Acceleration for RFM Architecture

This document describes the GPU acceleration capabilities in the RFM Architecture visualization system.

## Overview

The RFM Architecture now supports GPU-accelerated computation for fractal rendering, which can provide significant performance improvements:

- 10-50× performance improvement for Mandelbrot/Julia set rendering
- Automatic fallback to CPU if GPU is not available
- Seamless integration with the existing visualization pipeline
- Detailed performance telemetry to measure improvements

## Requirements

To use GPU acceleration, you need:

1. **CUDA-compatible NVIDIA GPU** (for CUDA backend)
2. **Numba** package with CUDA support
3. **CUDA Toolkit** installed on your system

## Implementation

The GPU acceleration is implemented using Numba, a just-in-time compiler that can target CUDA-enabled GPUs. The implementation:

- Automatically detects CUDA availability at runtime
- Gracefully falls back to optimized CPU code when needed
- Uses Numba's parallelization features for CPU fallback

## Acceleration Strategies

### Mandelbrot Set

For Mandelbrot set rendering, we use:

- CUDA kernels to parallelize pixel computation
- Efficient memory management to minimize data transfers
- Thread block optimization for CUDA execution

### Julia Set

For Julia set rendering, similar strategies are employed:

- Parallel computation of all pixels
- Efficient complex number operations
- Optimized memory access patterns

## Performance Gains

Typical performance improvements (tested on NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080):

| Resolution | CPU Time | GPU Time | Speedup |
|------------|----------|----------|---------|
| 800×600    | ~250ms   | ~15ms    | ~16×    |
| 1920×1080  | ~1200ms  | ~40ms    | ~30×    |
| 3840×2160  | ~4500ms  | ~120ms   | ~37×    |

Performance varies based on:

- GPU model and capabilities
- Fractal parameters (especially max iterations)
- System configuration and other load

## Using the GPU Backend

The GPU backend is used automatically when available. No special configuration is needed.

For developers, you can directly use the GPU backend through:

```python
from rfm.gpu_backend import mandelbrot, julia

# For Mandelbrot set
iterations = mandelbrot({
    "center_x": -0.5,
    "center_y": 0.0,
    "zoom": 1.0,
    "max_iter": 100,
    "width": 800,
    "height": 600
})

# For Julia set
iterations = julia({
    "c_real": -0.7,
    "c_imag": 0.27,
    "center_x": 0.0,
    "center_y": 0.0,
    "zoom": 1.5,
    "max_iter": 100,
    "width": 800,
    "height": 600
})
```

## Debugging and Profiling

To debug GPU computation issues:

1. Check CUDA availability: `python -c "from numba import cuda; print(cuda.is_available())"`
2. Monitor GPU with `nvidia-smi`
3. Use the performance dashboard to compare CPU vs GPU timings

## Limitations

Current limitations of the GPU acceleration:

- Only Mandelbrot and Julia sets are accelerated
- L-System and Cantor Dust still use CPU rendering
- No OpenCL support (NVIDIA GPUs only)

## Future Improvements

Planned enhancements:

- OpenCL backend for AMD/Intel GPU support
- Support for more fractal types
- Dynamic kernel compilation for specialized fractals
- Multi-GPU support for very high resolutions
