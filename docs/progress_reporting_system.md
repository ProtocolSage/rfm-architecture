# Real-Time Progress Reporting System

## Overview

The real-time progress reporting system provides comprehensive monitoring and visualization capabilities for long-running operations within the RFM Architecture. The system is built on a WebSocket-based communication protocol that enables bi-directional real-time updates between the computation backend and the user interface.

## Architecture

The system follows a client-server architecture with the following components:

### Server Components

- **WebSocket Server**: A central server that receives progress updates from operations and broadcasts them to connected clients.
- **Progress Reporter**: A utility class for reporting operation progress, completion, failures, and cancellations.
- **Progress Manager**: A centralized manager for tracking multiple concurrent operations.

### Client Components

- **WebSocket Client**: A client that connects to the WebSocket server and receives real-time updates.
- **Progress Bar**: A UI component for visualizing the progress of individual operations.
- **Progress Manager**: A UI component that manages the display of multiple progress bars.
- **Progress Timeline**: A visualization component that displays historical progress data.

### Communication Protocol

The system uses a JSON-based message protocol for communication:

- **Operation Started**: Notification that a new operation has started.
- **Progress Update**: Real-time updates on operation progress, including percentage and current step.
- **Operation Completed**: Notification that an operation has completed successfully.
- **Operation Failed**: Notification that an operation has failed with an error message.
- **Operation Canceled**: Notification that an operation has been canceled by the user.
- **Operation List**: A list of all active operations for initial synchronization.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Updates**: Immediate progress visualization during long-running operations.
- **Multi-Operation Support**: Track and visualize multiple concurrent operations.
- **Cancellation Support**: Allow users to cancel ongoing operations.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error reporting and visualization.
- **Historical Data**: Timeline view of recently completed operations.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track and visualize operation performance metrics.
- **Resilient Connections**: Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff and jitter.
- **Secure Communication**: SSL/TLS support for encrypted WebSocket connections.
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication for secure access control.
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against message flooding and abuse.
- **State Preservation**: Operation state maintained across reconnections.
- **Message Queuing**: Messages preserved during disconnection periods.
